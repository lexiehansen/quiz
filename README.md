# Javascript Quiz
Creating a timed coding quiz.

During this project I was able to create a quiz with a timer that begins upon clicking the start button, allows you to progress through multiple questions, and allows the game to end once the submit button is clicked or the timer reaches 0.

I was not able to complete the high score page, or able to make the timer deduct time for wrong answers.

A link to my project URL via GitHub is available [here](https://lexiehansen.github.io/quiz/).

Here is a screenshot of a question showing the countdown timer, and a screenshot of the score page.
